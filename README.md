# PRIMM: 1+1 = 11?

## Predict
Answer the following questions *without running the repo**.

1. What does this program output?
    > This program asks the user for two numbers, then outputs an equation where the two numbers are added to their solution.

2. If the user intended on outputting the sum of two numbers, does this program accomplish the purpose? Why/why not?
    > Yes. The program adds the two numbers together, then outputs that new number.

## Run
Run the program. 

1. What does the program output. Refer to what numbers you entered and what you got back.
    > The program doesn't add the numbers together, it just puts the numbers next to each other. when i inout 4 and 8, the out put was "4 + 8 = 48", which is incorrect.


## Investigate
1. Add a single-line comment above each major chunk of code to explain what is happening.
2. Read about the concept of [string concatenation](https://www.w3schools.com/python/gloss_python_string_concatenation.asp). Explain in your own words below what it is and how it relates to this program.
    > String concentration is when you add two strings together in one new string. For example, if you have the strings "Hello" and "World", string concentration can put these together into a new string containing "Hello World". In this situation, the numbers weren't mathematically added, they were just concentrated.

3. Read about the [`int()`](https://www.w3schools.com/python/ref_func_int.asp) and [`float()`](https://www.w3schools.com/python/ref_func_float.asp) functions in Python. What do they do? How can they help this program?
    > The ['int()'] function converts a number into an integer by removing any decimals. The ['float()'] function converts every number intoa  decimal. It gets rid of unnecessary zeros in decimals, and adds ".0" to any integers. These functions can help this program because they convert strings to numbers. Since the current variables are strign sin the program, we can convert them to numbers and then add them.

## Modify
1. Change the program using what you learned so that it adds two numbers you enter.
2. Try entered a non-numeric value. What happens? What kind of error is this (refer to our error types).
    > your answer

## Make
1. Add more lines of code to perform other math operations with the numbers you entered and print out the results. Try the following operators. 
    - `-`
    - `*`
    - `**`
    - `/`
    - `//`
    - `**`
    - `%`

2. Can you figure out what they do without looking them up? You might need to enter multiple numbers to figure it out. Fill in the table below.

| Operator | Meaning |
|  :---:    |   :---:   |  
|   `+`    | Addition |
|   `-`    | your answer |
|   `*`    | your answer |
|   `/`    | your answer |
|   `//`    | your answer |
|   `**`    | your answer |
|   `%`    | your answer |
